# Motivation

Imagine the following scenario:

1. You get brought on to an existing project
2. You write some code to handle some task
3. Your supervisor asks to review your code
4. You revise your code
5. You get pulled to another project 
6. Ten months later, you're asked to revise the code you barely remember to do something slightly different

This is a scenario that occurs with some frequency not only at HIP, but also at most other organizations. Unfortunately, this kind of scenario can give rise to some major pain, for any number of reasons, for example:

- Figuring out where the code lives
- Figuring out what some particular script does in relation to the others
- Figuring out what the data sources are and if they need to be changed
- Figuring out what object and variable names mean
- Figuring out why this code was written in a particularly way 

This may be the case whether you're reading someone else's code, or (even more commonly) you're reading code you wrote 10 months ago. The good news, however, is that most of these pain points can be prevented or mitigated by following some good practices from the beginning. 

The following is a guide and a series of tips to help you create code that is clear, legible, and adaptable. It is an opinionated guide, in the sense that much of what follows establishes subjective, but carefully considered, conventions. The intent is not to mandate inflexible requirements, but to present a set of good, generally applicable practices. 

This guide is written with writing R code in mind, but should be generally relevant regardless of programming language (keeping in mind some languages have specific conventions that should take precedence), or even to general project management outside of writing code.
